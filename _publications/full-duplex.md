By suppressing and cancelling the self-interference, the wireless full-duplex (FD) radios have shown promising results. Although theoretically the network throughput is assumed to be doubled in FD channels, the system throughput is far below 2 in reality due to the existence of hidden station problems. Therefore, a carefully designed MAC protocol is needed to avail full benefit of full-duplex radios. In this paper, we propose a novel FRTS/FCTS-based MAC protocol to further mitigate hidden station problems and improve the delay and throughput performance by introducing tertiary transmissions (TT) besides the previously known primary and secondary transmissions. Through realistic simulations in ns-3, we show that the proposed FD MAC protocol outperforms the conventional half-duplex MAC protocol for wireless networks in terms of system through-put. Also, the proposed FD MAC outperforms its counterpart busy tone-based FD MAC in terms of average delay.
