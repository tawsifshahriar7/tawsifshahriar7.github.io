Hi there! I'm Tawsif Shahriar, a student passionate about Computer Networks and Security.

My journey in Computer Security began when I got to know about CTF competitions. Since then, I've been on a mission to learn new things to contribute to this field. I believe in doing hard work in a smart way, and I'm dedicated to build my very own tool that will be of great help to the security researchers out there.

My approach to Computer Security is thinking out of the box, emphasizing different ways to look at a problem. I thrive in complex and focused environment when I am trying to solve a particular problem with deep analysis, where I can come up with new ideas.

When I'm not working, you can find me going to different places on a tour. I'm also passionate about mountain trekking and marathon, and I'm always looking for ways to develop my abilities.

I'm currently working on Ad Hoc Networking and Machine Learning, and I'm excited about Data Center Networking and Distributed Computing. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, feel free to mail me.

Let's connect and create something amazing together!
